This is a package I used when experimenting to develop new bioacoustic analyses.

I have now <u>deprecated this package</u> and am maintaining these functions elsewhere. For example:

[Postprocessing Library for BirdNET Analyzer Outputs](https://github.com/conormcmahon/birdnet_postprocessing)

[Comparing Density Estimates from Point Counts to Bioacoustic Detection Rates](https://github.com/conormcmahon/aru_point_count_analysis)

[Generate Taxonomic Metadata for Species Used in BirdNET](https://github.com/conormcmahon/birdnet_species_list_processing)
